# Cite Network Protocol
Cite is a platform for connecting content through citations to build up a global source of creative attribution context.

The goal of this repo is be a centralized source of information, technical and not, about Cite protocol, its justifications, and how it functions

# The Reason
The value of cite can be looked at in x ways
The value to the cited
The value to the Citer
The value to society.

Cite is built out of the firm belief that all three of these interested parties greatly benefit from ubiquitous socially expected recognition.

The cited

The citor

Society

Creativity is a social behavior. Though we mythologize the solitary creative genius, for the most part creativity a conversation between the influencer and influenced. This conversation is in a very real sense beautiful and also sacred. But at the same time any good willed influenced person must see the value and moral imperitive of recognition to maintain this beautiful and sacred conversation, for a variety of reason it is almost never given unless legally or socially compelled. Why is this?

I submit that the are 4 reason for this:

The hassle ie Friction nb this comes in 2 subsets which are important 1. the case in which you want to cite someone but doing so is either difficult to do (you would have to look it up etc etc) or how to do it effectively is unknown (where would I even put it where people would know) 2. Tracking it is too hard or impossible (i.e. I made this painting with no direct reference in mind but I am sure it is a combination of all the experiences I have had etc etc)

The Thief: The value of witholding credit is obvious and the there is no disincentive, i.e. theft = increased personal wealth, and who’s going to stop me

The selfish person: The value to the creator is not obvious, and I don’t care if other people get anything from it or not

The lazy person: I know it is the right thing to do and I would if it was easy, but it is a pain in the ass and I just want to be creative

The uneducation / ignorant person: I didn’t even know I was supposed to

The practical person: how would I do it such that it would even matter.

The goodwilled generous person: I will go out of my way to credit people, but I can’t really know where every idea comes from can I.

It is instructive to look at the ways in which all parties would react to being caught, that the further the person falls on the spectfum of good will the more they will claim their reason is farther on the other side of the spectrum.

If possible claim “I didn’t even know I was” if that is not plausable, “I didn’t know how to do it such that it would matter” if that isn’t plausible, “I didn’t know I was supposed to”, then “I meant to but forgot etc etc.








Now in certain environments, academic being the most obvious and easy to understand, it is very easy to explain why to cite. to quote … 

1. It gives proper credit to the authors of the words or ideas that you incorporated into your paper.
2. It allows those who are reading your work to locate your sources, in order to learn more about the ideas that you include in your paper.
3. Citing your sources consistently and accurately helps you avoid committing plagiarism in your writing.

I am adding this restatement my points to emphasize the lack of #4 




The hyper connectivity combined with speed of AI is turning that story changing how creative expression is realized and how valuable content emerges.


Creative attribution -— recognizing the intrinsic causal story of a content creation —- is a crucial shared truth for fostering mutually beneficial creative relationships. For attribution to be universally acknowledged, it must first be knowable; to be knowable, it must be tracked, recorded, and readily accessible to all. Only then can we begin to expect recognition to become ubiquitous.

# Cite Graph
Cite’s thesis can be summed up as the belief that with enough accurate contextual information people will enforce positive norms out of self interest. If I want to share work but fear theft, I will push for norms against theft for everyone if I think …

The foundation then is a database of context. Recognition does 3 things, 1) Rewards source 
2) It provides critical contextual information that can be used by others
3) It builds realtionships

Cite’s goal is to provide the minimal amount of effort for the maximum benifit. To do this the data model must be simple, straight forward, and yet highly valuable.

Cite’s model has 2 entities. And a citation is made up of an connection and a number. To cite a creator or a peice of content I need only to say who I am citing and how important they are

The Data model is made up of x components
Entities
  Creators
  Content

Connections
  Citation
  Link
